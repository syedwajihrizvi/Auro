This is an app that allows users to upload videos and photos and share them with other people. This was also made as part of the JS Mastery React Native tutorial.
The main thing I learned from this tutorial was how to upload files, images, videos in react-native and store them in a backend database.

1. Clone the repo locally
2. npm install
3. npx expo start
